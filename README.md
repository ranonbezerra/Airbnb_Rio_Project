# Project Context

 Airbnb is a company that anyone that has a room or a property of any kind can offer their place to be rented similarly as hotels would. 

 You, as a host, create your profile and the ad for your place, describing its characteristics as complete as possible, aiming to make your venue more attractive. Through your description that travelers and others choose the place that fits the best for them.

 Airbnb allows customization in several different ways in the host listing, since minimum number of nights, price, number of rooms, even cancelation rules, extra fee for extra guests, landlord identity verification requirement, etc.

 This project was done as an exercise of the Python course from 'Hashtag Programação', an online courses plataform from Brazil.
